     ↓
Google Gemini (Primary) + Ollama (Fallback)
     ↓
ERP Database (Customers, Orders, Leads, Invoices)
```

2. **sales_sql_write**: Create/update customer records  
3. **sales_rag_search**: Semantic search across customer data
4. **score_leads**: AI-powered lead scoring and qualification

## 🎬 Video Demo Script (10 minutes max)

### **Segment 1: System Overview (2 minutes)**
1. **Introduction**
   - Show project structure and files
   - Explain agent-driven ERP architecture
   - Highlight key components (Router, Sales Agent, Database)

2. **Technology Stack**
   - LangChain with ReAct pattern
   - Google Gemini for LLM processing
   - SQLite database with real business data
   - FastAPI + Streamlit for full-stack solution

### **Segment 2: Natural Language Interaction (3 minutes)**
1. **Start the System**
   ```bash
   # Show starting the system
   docker-compose up --build
   # Or locally:
   python quick_start.py
   ```

2. **Demonstrate Key Queries**
   ```
   "show recent customers"
   → Shows formatted customer list with contact info and revenue
   
   "display leads with high scores" 
   → Shows qualified leads with AI scoring
   
   "customer summary"
   → Shows business KPIs and metrics
   
   "system info"
   → Shows database status and agent health
   ```

3. **Show Both Interfaces**
   - API endpoint testing with curl
   - Streamlit web interface interaction

### **Segment 3: Agent Routing Demo (3 minutes)**
1. **Router Intelligence**
   - Show how different queries route to appropriate agents
   - Demonstrate the ReAct reasoning process
   - Show agent decision-making in logs

2. **Query Examples**
   ```
   Customer Query: "Who are our top customers?"
   → Routes to Sales Agent → Uses sales_sql_read tool
   
   Lead Query: "Show me qualified leads"
   → Routes to Sales Agent → Uses score_leads tool
   
   System Query: "What's the database status?"
   → Router handles directly → Uses get_system_info tool
   ```

### **Segment 4: Key ERP Tasks (2 minutes)**
1. **Adding New Customer/Order**
   ```
   "Add a new customer: TechCorp, email: tech@corp.com"
   → Uses sales_sql_write tool
   → Shows database update
   ```

2. **Lead Management**
   ```
   "Score all new leads"
   → Uses score_leads tool
   → Shows AI-powered qualification
   ```

3. **Business Intelligence**
   ```
   "Generate revenue report for top customers"
   → Complex query routing
   → Formatted business insights
   ```
